What is Knapsack?
-----------------

Knapsack is a sack that a contains a mixture of things, 
in this case code. At the moment the major contents are 
code for computational geometry, such as Bezier curves, 
splines, and blending functions.

It needs numpy in order to work.

The code is still in alpha.
